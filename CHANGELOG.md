# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-23 (branch `atlas/v7-foundation`, not yet released)

### Added
- Provider abstraction (`backend/app/providers/`) with per-provider capability flags, billing class and docs links.
- `POST /api/llm/chat/stream`: streaming replies as server-sent events (`start`, `delta`, `done`, `error`).
- Cancellation: the Stop button aborts generation, and the backend closes the provider connection.
- `POST /api/llm/models`: model discovery for Ollama (installed models only, never downloads) and cloud providers.
- `messages` (system/user/assistant) on chat endpoints, plus `temperature` and `max_tokens`. `prompt` still works.
- Latency, first-token time and token usage in responses when the provider reports them.
- Error classification: auth, rate limit, model not found, context too long, out of memory, timeout, unreachable.
- Bounded retries for connection failures only.
- `ATLAS_OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `ATLAS_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_PROVIDERS`, `ATLAS_<PROVIDER>_API_KEY`, `ATLAS_ENV`, `ATLAS_ENABLE_API_DOCS`, rate/size/retry limits (see `backend/.env.example`).
- Security headers and a strict CSP; request-body size limit; per-IP rate limit on model endpoints.
- `GET /api/system/status` and a live status panel in the UI.
- Chat UI: provider dropdown, model list, streaming, Stop, data-routing and billing notice, answer provenance line.
- Memory export to JSON.
- Browser end-to-end tests (Playwright + Chromium + fake Ollama), ruff lint with security rules, and CI jobs for e2e and the Docker build.
- Docs: audit, feature matrix, architecture, threat model, test plan, decisions, handoff.

### Changed
- `backend/app/main.py` split into `config`, `security`, `providers/` and `routers/`. All 18 original tests pass; their only change is blank lines between import groups added by ruff.
- Frontend JS/CSS moved to `frontend/static/` with no inline script.
- The task plan now comes from the backend `/api/tasks/plan` and is labelled simulation.
- Status labels now come from real data. "Local demo ready", agent "READY" and "0 External connections" were removed.
- Validation errors return a readable `detail` string and never echo input values.
- API docs are off when `ATLAS_ENV=production`.
- Docker image runs as a non-root user with a healthcheck and production mode.
- Runtime and dev requirements split (`requirements-dev.txt`).

### Fixed
- `backend/Dockerfile` could not build (`COPY ../frontend`); removed in favour of the root `Dockerfile`.
- Activity log showed a literal `\n`.
- The mobile layout overflowed to 747 px at a 390 px viewport.
- README test count and API docs path.
